I'm trying to make a website that randomly plays two simultaneous mp3s from 2 buckets of audio files. A collection of old answering machine messages and a bucket of ambient music. Every time the website is refreshed, the music and message clips are shuffled. It's sort of a kuleshov effect for audio.

How might we make this website 
ChatGPT said:

I dropped a working single-file prototype in the canvas (“Kuleshov Audio Pairing — index.html”). It’s a static page that, on each refresh, picks a random message + a random ambient track and plays them together with gentle fades. Because browsers need a user gesture, it uses a big Start button; after that you can Shuffle to get a new pairing.

Quick setup:

    Make two folders on your host: /audio/messages/ and /audio/ambient/.

    Upload your MP3s there.

    In the file’s FILES.messages and FILES.ambient arrays, paste the relative URLs (e.g. "audio/messages/1997-06-21-tina.mp3").

        Optional: set MANIFEST_URL to a JSON you host if you’d rather not hard-code lists.

    Open the page, click Start, and you’ll see which two files were paired, the seed, and the length. Shuffle to reroll.

Notes and options:

    Timing: The ambient clip is randomly offset so you hear a different segment under the full message (it fades both together when the message ends).

    Volume: Two sliders let you balance message vs ambient.

    Reproducible pairings: add ?seed=anything to the URL to share the same pairing.

    Hosting: Any static host (Netlify, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare). Keep files on the same origin to avoid CORS.

    Mobile: iOS/Safari require tap to begin — that’s normal.

    Next tweaks I can wire up fast: prevent immediate repeats, end when the shorter of the two finishes vs the message, cross-fade into a new pairing after X seconds, or add a “Share this pairing” button that copies a seeded link.

Want me to switch it to a manifest loader and auto-discover everything in your two buckets?

What's the cheapest way to get a host? I have a domain name via 123reg and that's it
ChatGPT said:

Cheapest paths, from “free and easy” to “still basically free but more scalable”:
1) GitHub Pages (free) — keep DNS at 123-reg

    Good for: tiny–small sites, a handful of MP3s.

    What you get: free hosting, custom domain + HTTPS, ~100 GB/month “soft” bandwidth, and a 1 GB site size cap. Each file in the repo must be <100 MB unless you use LFS.
    GitHub Docs+2GitHub Docs+2

    How to point your domain (no nameserver move needed):

        In 123-reg DNS, set A records for the apex (@) to: 185.199.108.153, .109.153, .110.153, .111.153, and a CNAME www → yourusername.github.io. Then enable the custom domain in the repo’s Pages settings so GitHub issues the cert.
        GitHub Docs+1

Pros: truly free, dead simple.
Cons: large/Many MP3s can hit repo/file limits; bandwidth is “soft-limited”.
2) GitHub Pages (site) + Cloudflare R2 (audio) — still free at small scale

    Good for: more/larger MP3s with predictable $0 egress.

    Host the website on GitHub Pages (as above), but store MP3s in an R2 public bucket and reference those URLs (or a JSON manifest) in your page.

    R2’s free tier: 10 GB storage, 1 M Class-A + 10 M Class-B ops per month, $0 egress (nice for audio). Beyond free, storage is ~$0.015/GB-mo.
    Cloudflare Docs
    Cloudflare
    r2-calculator.cloudflare.com

Pros: no bandwidth surprise bills for audio; you keep DNS at 123-reg if you want.
Cons: one extra dashboard (Cloudflare) and a tiny bit of CORS setup if you lock it down.
3) Cloudflare Pages (site) + Cloudflare R2 (audio) — free & very scalable

    Good for: “I want this to just work” and potentially lots of listening.

    Move DNS to Cloudflare (free) by changing nameservers at 123-reg, deploy the static site on Pages, store audio on R2, attach your custom domain, and you get free SSL + global CDN. Cloudflare self-serve plans don’t enforce bandwidth caps in the usual way, and Pages limits are mostly on builds, not traffic.
    Cloudflare
    Cloudflare Docs

    R2 gives you the same free tier + zero egress as above.
    Cloudflare Docs

Pros: great performance, simple “all-in-one” setup, zero egress for audio.
Cons: you do have to move DNS to Cloudflare.
4) Netlify Free or Vercel Hobby (nice DX, but bandwidth caps)

    Both have generous free tiers with ~100 GB/month bandwidth and easy custom domains + HTTPS. If you exceed that, you’ll need a paid tier or your site pauses until reset.
    Netlify
    Orb
    Northflank
    Flexprice

Pros: slick developer experience, quick deploys.
Cons: that 100 GB cap can go fast with audio.
5) Surge.sh (CLI-simple)

    One-command deploys; custom domains and basic SSL are free. Good for quick publishing if you like the CLI.
    surge.sh+1

What I’d pick for you

Since you already own a domain at 123-reg and you’ll be serving MP3s:

    Simplest (no DNS move): Option 2 — GitHub Pages for the site + Cloudflare R2 for audio. It stays free under the R2 10 GB tier and avoids GitHub’s large-file gotchas.
    GitHub Docs
    Cloudflare Docs

    “Set-and-forget” performance: Option 3 — move DNS to Cloudflare, use Pages + R2. Great if you ever expect lots of listeners.
    Cloudflare Docs

Quick start — Option 2 in 7 steps

    Create a public GitHub repo, enable GitHub Pages on main or /docs.
    GitHub Docs

    In 123-reg DNS, add:

        A @ → 185.199.108.153, .109.153, .110.153, .111.153

        CNAME www → yourusername.github.io
        Then set that domain in your repo’s Pages settings to get HTTPS.
        GitHub Docs

    Create a Cloudflare account → R2 → make a bucket public. Note the bucket’s public URL (or bind a custom subdomain later).
    Cloudflare Docs

    Upload your MP3s to R2 (folders like /messages/ and /ambient/).

    (Optional but tidy) Upload a small manifest.json to R2 that lists the file URLs.

    In the HTML I gave you, set MANIFEST_URL to that JSON, or paste the R2 URLs into FILES.messages and FILES.ambient.

    Push to GitHub → your site is live on your domain; audio streams from R2 with $0 egress.

If you’d rather go all-Cloudflare later, we can flip to Pages + R2 and I’ll adjust the code to fetch from your custom domain on R2 (and add a tiny CORS rule).

Want me to wire the page to load from a manifest by default and show a friendly “upload guide” panel?
You said:
Bear in mind I know nothing about all this stuff. I'm going with your github and cloudflare option.

I created an account on github, and created a public repo. How do I now , enable GitHub Pages?
ChatGPT said:

Great—nice choice. Here’s the click-path to turn on GitHub Pages for your repo:

    Open your repo → Settings (tab near the top).

    In the left sidebar, under Code and automation, click Pages.

    Under Build and deployment → Source, choose Deploy from a branch.

    Set Branch to main and Folder to / (root), then Save.
    GitHub Docs
    CollectionBuilder

Now add the web page:

    In your repo, click Add file → Create new file, name it index.html, paste the file I put in the canvas, and Commit to main. (A site needs an index.html in the folder you chose.)

Where to find your site URL:

    After Pages is enabled, the Settings → Pages screen shows the live URL (for a project repo it’ll look like https://<username>.github.io/<repo>).
    GitHub Docs

When you’re ready to put it on your own domain (via 123-reg):

    In Settings → Pages, add your custom domain.

    At 123-reg, add four A records for the apex (@) to:
    185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, 185.199.111.153
    and a CNAME www → <username>.github.io.
    Back on GitHub, tick Enforce HTTPS once it’s available.
    GitHub Docs+1

Want me to paste your audio file URLs into the page next, or set it to pull from a simple manifest.json on Cloudflare R2?
You said:
I can't see a way to "Set Branch to main and Folder to / (root)"

It's just this Branch > none > select branch drop down 
ChatGPT said:

That screen means your repo has no commits yet, so GitHub Pages can’t see a branch. Do this:

    In your repo, click Add file → Create new file.

    Name it index.html.

    Copy–paste the page I put in the canvas into that file.

    At the bottom, choose Commit directly to the main branch → Commit.

Now enable Pages:

    Go to Settings → Pages.

    Under Build and deployment → Source, pick Deploy from a branch.

    Set Branch to main (or whatever branch you just committed to) and Folder to / (root) → Save.

You’ll see the site URL at the top of that Pages screen (it’ll look like https://<username>.github.io/<repo>).

If the dropdown still shows only “None”:

    Make sure you actually committed the file to main (check the Code tab shows index.html).

    If your default branch is named something else (e.g. master), choose that instead.

    You can also use Add file → Upload files to drag in index.html if you prefer.

You said:
"In your repo, click Add file → Create new file."

How do I do that
ChatGPT said:

No worries — here’s exactly where to click.
If your repo is empty (you see a “Quick setup” screen)

    Open your repo’s Code tab.

    In the big starter box, click creating a new file (link text) — or Add a README (either will create the first commit).

    On the new file page, in Name your file…, type index.html.

    Paste the page code.

    Scroll down, keep Commit directly to the main branch selected, click Commit new file.

If you already see a file list

    On the Code tab, click the green Add file button (top-right of the file list).

    Choose Create new file.

    Name it index.html, paste code, Commit to main.

Quick shortcut (works either way)

    In your browser, go to: https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>/new/main/
    That jumps straight to the “Create new file” screen.

After you commit index.html, go back to Settings → Pages, set Source: Deploy from a branch, Branch: main, Folder: /, Save.
You said:
I pasted the code from above that you provided, but cannot see "Commit directly to the main branch"
ChatGPT said:

Gotcha — GitHub’s UI shows a few different commit buttons. Do this:

    Make sure you’re on the Create new file screen and you’ve typed a file name at the very top: index.html.

    Paste the code into the big editor.

Now commit (you’ll see one of these UIs):

    A. Green “Commit new file” button at the bottom → click it. That creates the first commit on main.

    B. Blue “Commit changes…” button at the top-right → click it, a small dialog opens. Leave the message as is, ensure the option says Commit directly to the main branch, then click Commit changes.

    C. Button says “Propose new file” → click the tiny ▼ next to it and pick Commit directly to the main branch (or switch the radio from “create a new branch” to “main”), then commit.

If none of those appear, double-check:

    You named the file index.html at the very top. Without a filename, the commit button can be disabled or hidden.

    You’re logged into the account that owns the repo and you’re on the Code tab → Add file → Create new file page (URL ends with /new/main/).

Once it commits, go to Settings → Pages:

    Source: Deploy from a branch

    Branch: main

    Folder: / (root)

    Save

You’ll see your site URL appear on that page. Want me to switch the code to load a manifest.json from Cloudflare R2 next?
You said:
It looks like this
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — you’re in the right place. From that screen:

    Click the green Commit changes… button (top-right).

    A small panel opens. Make sure the option says Commit directly to the main branch (not “create a new branch”).

    Click the green Commit changes in that panel.

Then turn on Pages:

    Go to your repo’s Settings tab → Pages (left sidebar).

    Under Build and deployment → Source, pick Deploy from a branch.

    Set Branch = main, Folder = / (root), then Save.

    A site URL will appear at the top of that Pages screen (it’ll look like https://<username>.github.io/<repo>). Click it to open.

After it’s live, the page will load but won’t play audio until we add file URLs. Want me to switch the code to load a manifest.json from Cloudflare R2 next, or do you want to paste a few MP3 URLs straight into the FILES.messages and FILES.ambient arrays?
You said:
I clicked the green button and this pops up
ChatGPT said:

Great — that’s the right popup.

Do this:

    Leave the Commit message as “Create index.html” (fine).

    In that same popup, either:

        If you see radio options, pick Commit directly to the main branch.

        If you don’t see options, scroll inside the popup a bit — they’re often just below the description box.

        If there’s a tiny ▼ next to the green button, click it and choose Commit to main.

    Click the green Commit changes button.

Next:
4) Go to Settings → Pages (left sidebar).
5) Source: Deploy from a branch → Branch: main → Folder: / → Save.
6) A URL will appear at the top of that page; click it to open your site.

Tell me when that’s up, and I’ll help you point the page at your audio (either paste a few MP3 URLs or we’ll hook up a Cloudflare R2 manifest).
You said:
"In that same popup, either:

None of these options are present. I can only edit the commit message, write in an extended description, or hit commit changes
ChatGPT said:

All good — that popup is the right one. On your own repo, GitHub often hides the branch choice because the default is to commit to main.

Do this now:

    Leave the message as “Create index.html”.

    Click the green Commit changes button.

Then:
3) Go to the repo’s Code tab and confirm you see index.html listed and the blue branch pill says main.
4) Open Settings → Pages (left sidebar).
5) Under Build and deployment → Source, choose Deploy from a branch.
6) Set Branch = main, Folder = / (root), then Save.

You’ll see the site URL at the top of that Pages screen (for your repo it should look like:
https://listenmachine.github.io/listenmachine/).

Once that’s showing, we’ll plug in your audio:

    Easiest next step: paste a couple of MP3 URLs into the FILES.messages and FILES.ambient arrays in index.html.

    Or I can switch the page to pull from a manifest.json you’ll upload to Cloudflare R2.

You said:
I see no blue pill under my code tab
ChatGPT said:

You’re good — that screen shows your file is committed to the main branch (the little grey “main” badge above the file list). The blue box on the right (“special repository”) just means this repo name matches your username; it doesn’t block Pages.

Do this next:

    Open the repo’s Settings tab.

    In the left sidebar, click Pages.

    Under Build and deployment → Source, change to Deploy from a branch.

    Branch: choose main. Folder: choose / (root).

    Click Save.

Where to find it:

    The Pages screen will show your site URL at the top once it’s queued, something like
    https://listenmachine.github.io/listenmachine/.

    If you don’t see the URL yet, click the Actions tab and look for the workflow named “pages build and deployment”; when it’s green, the site is live.

Tell me when that link appears and I’ll help you point the page at your audio files (either paste a couple of MP3 URLs into the arrays, or we’ll wire it to a Cloudflare R2 manifest.json).
You said:
I did all that and hit save



I don't see a url?
ChatGPT said:

Nice — Pages is configured. Now grab the live link like this:

Option A (quickest):

    On that same Settings → Pages screen, the words “your site” are a link. Click it.

Option B (always works):

    Go to the Actions tab.

    Open the workflow named “pages build and deployment.”

    When the run shows a green check, look on the right for Deployments → github-pages → View deployment. That button opens your site.

Option C (pattern):

    Your project-site URL will be
    https://listenmachine.github.io/listenmachine/

Open it and you should see the page with the Start / Shuffle buttons.

Once you can load the page, tell me which you prefer next:

    Paste a couple MP3 URLs straight into FILES.messages and FILES.ambient, or

    Use a Cloudflare R2 manifest so you don’t hard-code anything. I can tweak the page for the manifest loader in one go.

You said:
Seems to work!

Now what
ChatGPT said:

Awesome — the page is live. Next we’ll host the audio on Cloudflare R2 and point the page at a tiny manifest.json.
Step 1 — Make an R2 bucket (public)

    Log in to Cloudflare → left sidebar R2 → Create bucket.

    Name it (e.g. listenmachine).

    In the bucket → Settings → Public access → set to Public.

        Copy the Public bucket URL (looks like https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev).

Step 2 — Upload your files

    Inside the bucket, Create folder messages and another ambient.

    Upload your MP3s into the right folders.

        Tip: you can select a file and click Copy public link to get its full URL.

Step 3 — Create manifest.json

On your computer, make a file named manifest.json like this (use your R2 public URL and your filenames):

{
  "messages": [
    "https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/messages/1997-06-21-tina.mp3",
    "https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/messages/1998-01-04-dad.mp3"
  ],
  "ambient": [
    "https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/ambient/soft-pad-01.mp3",
    "https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/ambient/rain-room-02.mp3"
  ]
}

Upload manifest.json to the root of the bucket (same level as messages/ and ambient/).
Open the link in your browser to confirm it’s reachable:
https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/manifest.json
Step 4 — Allow your site to fetch from R2 (CORS)

In the bucket: Settings → CORS → Add rule

    Allowed origins: https://listenmachine.github.io

    Allowed methods: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS

    Allowed headers: *

    Expose headers: Accept-Ranges, Content-Length, Content-Range

    Max age: 86400

Save.
Step 5 — Point the page at the manifest

    In your GitHub repo, open index.html → click the ✏️ edit icon.

    Find this line near the top:

const MANIFEST_URL = null; // e.g., '/audio/manifest.json' or leave null

    Replace it with your manifest URL:

const MANIFEST_URL = "https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/manifest.json";

    Commit changes.

    Refresh your live site and click Start — it should pick a random message + ambient from your bucket.

If something doesn’t play

    CORS error in console: recheck Step 4 (origins and methods).

    404 on manifest or MP3: open the URL directly to confirm it’s public.

    Mixed content: make sure all links are https.

    Nothing starts on mobile: tap Start first (required by browsers).

Want me to update the page to only use the manifest (hide the arrays) and add a little “Files loaded from Cloudflare R2” note?
You said:
Let's go slowly. I just created a cloudflare account and am greeted with this 
ChatGPT said:

You don’t need to connect your domain to use R2. That screen is for putting your whole site behind Cloudflare – we’re only using R2 storage for the MP3s.

Do this:
Get to R2 (skip the domain step)

    If there’s a Skip or Maybe later link, click it.

    If not, click the Cloudflare logo (top-left) to go to the dashboard home, then in the left sidebar click R2 (under “Storage”).

        If you don’t see R2 yet, click Workers & Pages once; it usually enables the developer products and R2 will appear.

Create a public bucket

    R2 → Create bucket. Name it something like listenmachine.

    Open the bucket → Settings → Public access → enable Public.

        Copy the Public bucket URL (it will look like https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev). We’ll need it.

Add folders and upload

    In the bucket, create two folders: messages and ambient.

    Upload your MP3s into the right folder.

        You can click a file and use Copy public link to see its full URL.

Allow your GitHub site to fetch from R2 (CORS)

Bucket → Settings → CORS → Add rule

    Allowed origins: https://listenmachine.github.io

    Allowed methods: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS

    Allowed headers: *

    Expose headers: Accept-Ranges, Content-Length, Content-Range

    Max age: 86400
    Save.

Make the simple manifest

Create a file named manifest.json on your computer like:

{
  "messages": [
    "https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/messages/first-message.mp3",
    "https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/messages/second-message.mp3"
  ],
  "ambient": [
    "https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/ambient/pad-01.mp3",
    "https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/ambient/rain-02.mp3"
  ]
}

Upload manifest.json to the root of the bucket (same level as the two folders). Open the URL in your browser to confirm it loads:
https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/manifest.json
Point your page at the manifest

    Back on GitHub → your repo → open index.html and click the pencil (edit).

    Find:

const MANIFEST_URL = null;

    Replace with:

const MANIFEST_URL = "https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/manifest.json";

    Commit changes, refresh your live site, click Start.

If you get stuck on any one step (e.g., can’t find the Public access toggle or CORS), tell me what you see and I’ll translate that exact screen.
You said:
ChatGPT said:

Great — click the top result: “R2 object storage.” Then follow these exact steps:
A) Create a public bucket

    Click Create bucket.

    Name: listenmachine (any name is fine).

    Leave other options as-is → Create bucket.

    Open the bucket you just made → Settings (top tabs) → Public access → turn On.

        Copy the Public bucket URL it shows (looks like https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev). We’ll need it.

B) Allow your GitHub site to fetch from R2 (CORS)

Still in Bucket → Settings:

    CORS → Add rule

        Allowed origins: https://listenmachine.github.io

        Allowed methods: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS

        Allowed headers: *

        Expose headers: Accept-Ranges, Content-Length, Content-Range

        Max age: 86400

    Save.

C) Upload your audio

    Go to the bucket’s Objects tab.

    Create folder: messages and another ambient.

    Upload your MP3s into the right folder.

        Click a file → Copy public link to see its full URL.

D) Make the manifest.json

    On your computer, create a file named manifest.json like this (replace with your real URLs; use the “Copy public link” you just tested):

{
  "messages": [
    "https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/messages/1997-06-21-tina.mp3",
    "https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/messages/1998-01-04-dad.mp3"
  ],
  "ambient": [
    "https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/ambient/soft-pad-01.mp3",
    "https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/ambient/rain-room-02.mp3"
  ]
}

    Upload manifest.json to the root of the bucket (same level as the two folders).

    Open its URL in your browser to confirm it loads:
    https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/manifest.json

E) Point your page at the manifest

    Back on GitHub → open your repo → click index.html → the ✏️ edit icon.

    Find this line near the top and replace it:

const MANIFEST_URL = "https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev/manifest.json";

    Commit changes, refresh your live site, click Start. You should hear a random message over a random ambient track.

Stuck anywhere? Tell me exactly which screen you’re on and what you see (a screenshot helps), and I’ll translate that step.
You said:
I  didn't realise with cloudflare I'd have to give them card information. Is there no way to just hit a cap?

If not, perhaps we go with the truly free option you offered
ChatGPT said:

Totally fair — R2 wants a card on file and there’s no hard spend-cap you can flip on. Let’s go with the truly free route: keep everything on GitHub Pages (same origin, no CORS hassle).
Put the MP3s in your repo

We’ll make two folders and upload a couple of files to test.

    In your repo’s Code tab, click Add file → Create new file.

    In the filename box, type: audio/messages/.gitkeep → scroll down → Commit changes.

    Repeat and create: audio/ambient/.gitkeep → Commit changes.

        Those tiny .gitkeep files just create the folders; we can delete them later.

    Click into audio/messages/ → Add file → Upload files → drag a few message MP3s → Commit changes.

    Do the same in audio/ambient/ for a couple of ambient tracks.

Heads-up on limits (for free):

    Keep each file < 100 MB.

    Keep the repo size roughly ≤ ~1 GB for comfort.
    If you have loads of long tracks, consider exporting lighter versions (e.g., voice messages ~96–128 kbps mono; ambient ~160–192 kbps stereo).

Point the page at those files

    Open index.html in GitHub → click the ✏️ Edit icon.

    Near the top, find the FILES = { messages: [...], ambient: [...] } block.

    Paste relative URLs to your files, like:

const FILES = {
  messages: [
    "audio/messages/1997-06-21-tina.mp3",
    "audio/messages/1998-01-04-dad.mp3"
  ],
  ambient: [
    "audio/ambient/pad-soft-01.mp3",
    "audio/ambient/room-rain-02.mp3"
  ]
};

// Make sure this stays null when using local files:
const MANIFEST_URL = null;

    Commit changes.

    Reload your live site and click Start. You should hear a random pair.

Optional tidy-ups

    After you’ve uploaded real files, you can delete those .gitkeep placeholders.

    Later, if you outgrow GitHub’s limits, we can migrate only the audio to a “bucket” host. For now, this setup is free and simple.

Want me to add a tiny “no repeats until all played” tweak or a “Share this pairing” link next?

In this chat I can’t pull the Wayback source directly (the archive loads the page through a JS wrapper my tools can’t open), but your live snapshot is enough to know the concept: on each refresh it pairs a random answering-machine clip with a random ambient bed and plays them together. That matches what we’ve already built, and a 2013 write-up describes ListenMachine the same way: a new pairing each page load.
VICE

If you want me to match the old site exactly, here’s how to grab the archived code in your browser so you can paste it here and I’ll translate it 1:1:

    Open your snapshot link.

    Press Ctrl/Cmd+U (or right-click → View page source).

    Copy everything you see and paste it here.

        If there are extra <script> and <link> tags with web.archive.org prefixes, that’s normal; I’ll strip the archive wrappers.

    Optional: open DevTools → Network → filter by mp3, refresh once, and copy any MP3 URLs the archive actually saved (many old assets aren’t archived, but we can swap in your new audio).

In the meantime, here’s what I can lift straight into our new version to emulate the old behaviour:

    Auto-shuffle on refresh (no Shuffle button needed).

    Minimal “ListenMachine” look instead of a card UI.

    Random start point in the ambient track so every pairing feels different even with the same files (already in the prototype).

    Gentle fades in/out so there are no pops (already in).

    A shareable seeded URL like ?seed=abc to reproduce a pairing (already in).

If you’d like, I’ll tweak the page now to:

    start a new random pairing immediately after you click Start once (browsers require one user gesture per session),

    remove the extra UI, and

    add a tiny “refresh to reroll” hint so it behaves like the original.

Or, paste the Wayback page source and I’ll mirror its layout and any easter-eggs it had, then wire it to your GitHub-hosted MP3s.

Yes—great find. I pulled out what your old page actually did and rewrote it in a clean, modern, single-file version you can drop into your repo.
What the 2016 page did (useful bits)

    Two <audio> tags: one for ambient, one for message.

    It listed an S3 bucket, grabbed every key under ambient/ and machine/, then shuffled both lists.

    It started ambient immediately at volume 0.8, waited 5 seconds, then started message and faded that up to 0.4 over ~1s.

    When either track finished or errored, it advanced to the next file (so you got a full shuffle cycle before repeats).

    Minimal UI: just the “ListenMachine” title and a background image.

Modern browsers block autoplay, so we need one click to start. Otherwise we can keep the behaviour identical.
Drop-in “classic” page (no jQuery, no S3; works on GitHub Pages)

Paste this over your index.html, then put MP3s in audio/messages/ and audio/ambient/ in your repo (each file <100 MB).

Where to put your audio (free + simple)

    In your repo, create folders: audio/messages/ and audio/ambient/.

    Upload a few MP3s (keep each under 100 MB).

    Edit the arrays at the top of the page to list them with relative paths, e.g.:

        "audio/messages/1998-01-04-dad.mp3"

        "audio/ambient/soft-pad-01.mp3"

That reproduces the old site’s behaviour (shuffle once per load, ambient first, message fades in after five seconds, loop to next clip when each ends). It also handles errors gracefully and doesn’t need jQuery or S3.

If you want the exact old look (background image + the big “ListenMachine” header) just put a background file in your repo and set the body CSS url("audio/bg.jpg") (or whatever path you like).

One issue with the old site is back in the day you could have audio auto-play. Now you can't. Can you tweak the site so there's a play button, which allows permission to start>
ChatGPT said:

Done! I simplified the page to use a single Play button that grants audio permission and starts the pairing. I also removed the Shuffle/Stop code so there aren’t any hidden references that could crash autoplay.

To publish the change:

    In your GitHub repo, open index.html → click the ✏️ Edit icon.

    Select all, paste the updated version from the canvas, and Commit changes.

    Reload your live page and tap Play — you’re good.

    Want a tiny “Play again” button after it finishes, or continuous looping like the old site? I can wire either in next.

You said:
Thanks. So the play button is supposed to just start the website playing the randomised audio files. They should keep playing forever. Is this not currently the case? I was just assuming we needed a play button to essentially grant the website permission to start playing audio

Great question — and you’re exactly right about the intent. The Play button is only there to satisfy modern autoplay rules. After that one click, it should just keep generating new pairings.

I’ve now wired your page to do exactly that:

    After you press Play, it loads a random message + ambient, plays them with the fade, and when the message finishes it automatically rolls a fresh pairing and starts again.

    If you use a ?seed=... in the URL, it will now advance the seed each cycle so you don’t get the same pair repeating forever.

To publish the change, open index.html in your repo, click the pencil, paste the updated file from the canvas, and commit. Then reload your site and press Play once — it’ll run indefinitely.

Want a crossfade into each new pairing (no gap), or a “never repeat until all are heard” rule for each bucket? I can drop either in.
